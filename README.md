# SlimeBall
 A simple game using IndigoECS. Note that this repository is only the simulation part of the game, and is not playable on its own. This simulation can be run from any engine that can run C# code. For my client implementation in Unity, see [SlimeBallUnityClient](https://github.com/rdshack/IndigoECS)
